# AutomatedTrader

This is an exercise to implement the TradingAlgorithm interface.

## Importing the Project via IntelliJ

1. Import the Project via IntelliJ
2. Configure the Project to use Java 8

## Running the Unit Test

### Running via Gradle in Command Line

```
$ ./gradlew test
```

### Running via IntelliJ

1. Add a run configuration for all JUnit tests on the project
2. To enable Cofoja on unit test runs, configure the IntelliJ unit test run configuration for the JUnit tests to pass the following VM options:
```
-javaagent:lib/cofoja.asm-1.3-20160207.jar
```
3. To be able to instrument the code with Cofoja, configure IntelliJ to run the Gradle ```build``` task prior to running the tests.

## Installing and Running the REPL

A REPL was introduced to be able to test the trading algorithm. These are the steps to build, install, and run the REPL.

1. On a Terminal, go to the project directory and issue the following command:
```
$ ./gradlew clean installDist
```
2. Then on the same command line, you can run the application via this command:
```
$ ./build/install/AutomatedTrader/bin/AutomatedTrader
```

### REPL Commands

You can always get help by issuing this command on the REPL: ```help()```

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|help() | Gives you the list of all commands |
|reset()| Resets the environment. The algorithm setup and the price feeds are wiped out.|
|exit() | Exit the REPL.|
|setup(String... productNames) | Sets up the algorithm to process these productNames. Any other productName is not tradable.|
|price(String productName, double quotedPrice) | This simulates a price feed and is given to the TradingAlgorithm setup in the environment. This may or may not result in a trade.|

### REPL Sample Session

```
$ ./build/install/AutomatedTrader/bin/AutomatedTrader
Welcome to the AutomatedTrader REPL

>>>	help()
* Help Menu
	help()	this message
	reset()	reset the environment
	exit()	REPL exits loop
	setup(String... productNames)	Sets up the TradingAlgorithm. Only productNames specified are tradable.
	price(String productName, double quotedPrice)	Offer a price feed to the TradingAlgorithm.

>>>	price(a, 1)
ERROR: Algorithm not setup. Please setup via setupTradingAlgorithm(String... productNames) command first before price feed.

>>>	setup(a)
* BuyWhenBullishTradingAlgorithm{productNames=[a]}

>>>	price(a, 1)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 2)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 3)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 4)
* Trade{ productName: a, tradeDirection: BUY, priceValue: 4.0, quantity: 1000 }

>>>	reset()
* Environment reset.

>>>	price(a, 5)
ERROR: Algorithm not setup. Please setup via setupTradingAlgorithm(String... productNames) command first before price feed.

>>>	setup(a)
* BuyWhenBullishTradingAlgorithm{productNames=[a]}

>>>	price(a, 6)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 7)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 8)
* no trade

>>>	price(a, 9)
* Trade{ productName: a, tradeDirection: BUY, priceValue: 9.0, quantity: 1000 }

>>>	exit()
$
```
